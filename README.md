# NCycle Test Results

This is a small TypeScript project that demonstrates the usage of TypeScript classes and their integration with HTML using Bootstrap for styling. The project consists of a TypeScript file (index.ts) that defines a generic class `NCycle` and an HTML file (index.html) that displays the test results dynamically.

## Features

- The `NCycle` class is a generic class that represents a cycle with make, model, and wheels properties.
- The class provides methods to print information about the cycle, both individually and for all instances.
- Test data is provided to demonstrate the functionality of the `NCycle` class.
- The results of the test cases are displayed dynamically in the HTML document using JavaScript.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

You should see the test results displayed in the browser window. If you open the developer console, you may see additional information logged there.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file that displays the test results.
- `index.ts`: TypeScript file containing the definition of the `NCycle` class and the test data.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies
